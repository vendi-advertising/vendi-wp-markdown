## Description 

Check the box per-post to eable Markdown for the current post or page and start typing.

This plugin uses [Michel Fortin's](https://michelf.ca/) [awesome library](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown) which is based on the [Markdown created by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/). All credit for anything related to Markdown should go to those people, this plugin just gives access to Markdown from WordPress.

Markdown syntax can be viewed [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).



## Installation 

For an automatic installation through WordPress:

1. Go to the 'Add New' plugins screen in your WordPress admin area

## Frequently Asked Questions 


### Can I preview my Markdown before publishing? 

At this time we are disabling TinyMCE's WYSIWYG editor in Markdown mode so you cannot switch back and forth between "Visual" and "Text" modes. We are considering adding support for this in the future if enough people request it.


### Does this work with multiple TinyMCE instances? 

At this moment no, this feature is not supported.


### Does this work with Multisite? 

Although it has not been tested there is no reason that this shouldn't work with Multisite.


### What exactly does this plugin do? 

WordPress stores your post's body in a field in the database called `post_content` however it also allows for a second field called `post_content_filtered`. When you hit "Save" on your post/page this plugin converts your content from Markdown to HTML, the Markdown gets stored in `post_content_filtered` and the HTML gets stored in `post_content`. Because we are rendering on the admin side the rest of WordPress only ever interacts with the HTML.


### Will this plugin slow my site down? 
No. Because we render on the admin side of things (see the previous question for more details) individual page-renders won't be affected by this plugin.


### Is Markdown extra supported? 
Not at this time.


### Can I customize the configuration of the Markdown parser? 

Not at this time.


## Changelog 


### 1.0.1 
Renamed variable


### 1.0.0 
First release


## Roadmap 
Version 1 is the very simple proof of concept that just works.  It is intended to be used by people who know what Markdown is and when they should and shouldn't use it. Specifically it doesn't address multiple editors on a single page nor does it support widgets. There are also no global settings, just on and off per post/page.

Version 2 might possibly add support for previewing Markdown and possibly converting HTML to Markdown via the [PHP League's awesome library](https://github.com/thephpleague/html-to-markdown). I'd also like to get WordPress's preview system working but that might be blocked by [this](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20299) and/or [this](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20564).
